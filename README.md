# movie-recommendation-engine
**A basic movie recommendation engine (GUI) which recommends a random film**

This is my first GUI application using Tkinter. The **photo** directory will store the '.jpg'
movie poster from the last exeution of program.
The **data** directory contains two .csv files which locally stores about 9000 movies'
information.

```
python3.5 recommendation-engine.py

pip3 install beautifulsoup4
