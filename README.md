# movie-recommendation-engine
**A basic movie recommendation engine (GUI) which recommends a random film**

This is my first GUI application using Tkinter. The **photo** directory will store the '.jpg'
movie poster from the last exeution of program.
The **data** directory contains two .csv files which locally stores about 9000 movies'
information.

## How to run the code
You can run the code normally by entering:
```
python3.5 recommendation-engine.py
```

**Note: If you get an error 'no such module' for ImageTk, use the following code to download
ImageTk for python3 and above**
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk
```
